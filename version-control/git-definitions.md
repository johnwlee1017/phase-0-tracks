# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that keeps track and records changes to files. It is useful because you can recall any versions of a file you have previously saved.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a repo, which allows you to make changes without changing the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you record changes to a repo. A good commit message should be simple and clearly state what you did - in imperative tense.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you integrate another branch to your current branch and there is some type of discrepancy.
