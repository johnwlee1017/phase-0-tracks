jQuery

I plan to search for a few resources (jQuery site, intro to jQuery, tutorials, etc.) on jQuery and find examples of how it works and how I can apply it.  I plan to test what I learned after learning each new concept.

It was very useful (helped with my learning) by reviewing w3schools, digitalocean, and documentation on jQuery site.  After reviewing some of the material I would start implementing jQuery by writing the code and testing it out.
