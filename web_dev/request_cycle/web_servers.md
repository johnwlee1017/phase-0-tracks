In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
- A VPS is like having a dedicated server but since it's "virtual" you can have serveral VPSs (each one with own operating system) on your computer.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
- There is a risk of losing data/files/etc from a bug/crash while running programs as the root user.  It's good practice on any operating system to run applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user.
