Release 2

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

- input:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;
- output:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Great venue!
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Perfect venue!
Steven|Wonder|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bad club!

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

- input:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id WHERE businesses.id = 1;
- output:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Great venue!
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Perfect venue!
